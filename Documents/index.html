            <p> The vast world of Information Technology has always mesmerized me to a great extent and has also led me to delve into how it could shape the future. The flexibility offered through IT careers are quite promising as they are designed to cater for the growing needs of the consumers as well as the latest advancements in the world of technology. Although I have not got any solid experience in this field, but I do feel that this is something that I have always wanted to do and pursue as my career.</p>

            <p> Nothing brings people together like great food, hence why I love to cook. I absolutely love to explore different cuisines and dishes from all around the world. Cooking creates a culture of giving and receiving positive energy to the people around us, which is why it acts as a form of meditation for me.</p>

            <p> I am not that good at programming therefore my aim in this project would be to enhance my programming skills. This is because IT mainly evolves around different programs, therefore developing a good grasp of different programming languages can help one develop intuitive apps that the whole world relies upon.</p>

            <p> Most of my team members genuinely believe that they need to improve their programming skills. Programming is one unique and a challenging language which takes a good amount of time for one to grasp a good understanding off. Therefore, the aim behind this project is to not only provide the most desirable user experience to the users but to also enhance and uplift our programming skills.</p>

            <p> My challenge would be to finish this project in the time frame provided and to a top-notch quality. It is crucial that we as a group fulfill the requirements to the best of our ability and provide desirable outcome upon the completion of this IT project.</p> 

            <p> The specific types of tasks that I see myself contributing to the team includes helping my team during the design and development stages which basically includes creating detailed prototypes, writing a description about what the app will entail and developing the app itself.

            <p> I am an international student from India studying IT at RMIT University and I basically belong to Punjabi culture. My family lives in India and I arrived here in Melbourne last month. I have completed my grade 12th in Non-medical stream where my main subjects were Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. I have studied very little about HTML in my 10th grade because of which I am here today pursuing my career in IT. And because of my multi-cultured country, I can speak three languages which are English, Hindi, and Punjabi. My biggest dream is to explore the world and enjoy the beauty of nature all over the globe. I have a huge passion for fashion trends and I love to try them out too. I have done modeling, anchoring, and singing in my high school. I love to participate in different activities. My hobbies include hairstyling and poetry writing. </p>

            <p> I am a very good learner as I love to learn new and innovative things that I could also implement in real life. I also have the ability to work individually as well as with a group.</p>
            
            <p> I have learned to create web pages using HTML in the previous semester and I have found that I am pretty good at it.</p> 
            
            <p> According to me, the huge challenge is to implement all the ideas perfectly into our project in a clear and sophisticated way. </p>

            <p> Contribution: I am really good at managing multiple things and I think this will help all the group members as well.</p>

            <p>  I have lived in Melbourne’s southeast for most of my life, I did not know what I wanted to do for my career until I talked to some friends who are in the IT industry and was intrigued. I have been studying at RMIT since 2018 doing an advance diploma in computer systems engineering, I decided that I wanted to continue my knowledge and do a Bachelor of Information Technology. I love a challenge and as IT is so diverse, there is always something new that you can learn. </p>

            <p> I enjoy working as part of a team, I have some experience with networking, cisco CCNA routing and switching, windows server 2016 and windows 10, Linux desktop and server and web development. I am very interested in Cybersecurity, I would like to do a master’s in Cybersecurity after this course if I can, but if not I would love to work in an IT department for a global organization that would allow me to travel.</p>

            <p> The areas that I could improve in the time managing, it’s an easy thing to fix but in the current situations with Covid-19 I am finding it a little hard. I would love to develop some knowledge and skills in developing an application, and working as a team to tackle something that most of us have not had any experiences in.</p>

            <p> The team seems like they are challenged in the same areas that I am, we don’t have much if any skills or knowledge in developing an application. I believe we have a strong team that will be putting in the effort to achieve and complete as much of our application as we can!</p>

            <p> The challengers will be building the application itself and the implementing of the features into our application.</p>

            <p> I see myself doing some of the programming and web development for our group project, and I will assist any member of the team if they request. </p>

            <p> I was born and raised in Pakistan and moved to Australia back in 2016. I have had a strong passion for Information Technology since I was a kid which is why I studied IT in high school. At that time, I decided that I am going to study IT in the future. I love how everything revolves around IT these days. IT gives us a chance to create our virtual world and I would like to create my own. So that I can bring my thoughts into reality.</p>

            <p> I am interested in cybersecurity as we all know it is one of the pillars of technology these days and it will be the main aspect of IT in the future. By keeping this in mind, I am also studying Certificate IV in cybersecurity so I can pursue my career in cybersecurity in the coming days. Apart from this, I like to play cricket as it teaches how teamwork, leadership, and patience leads us to success.</p>

            <p> My programming skills could be improved a lot as I know from now on until the end of the degree there will be a lot of subjects which will require a high level of programming. Therefore, my main aim of this project will be to polish my programming skills in a way to help me in other subjects.</p>

            <p> As most of us are new to this field, we all are facing similar problems. Therefore, we will try to help each other as much as we can and to challenge all of us to the best of our abilities. We will work all together however we’ll split in different paths to be more efficient and effective.</p>

            <p> In a project, many factors need to be done but the main challenge would be dividing tasks equally among the team. Additionally, I want to contribute more towards the designing and coding side but mainly I want to work as a part of a team.</p>

            <p> I want to contribute as much as I can as there are many factors that need to be done. I see myself leading my team successfully creating a website from scratch. I know it’s difficult but not impossible. </p>

            <p> My interest in IT stems from both my occupation as an Army Signals Officer and curiosity for programming and computer hardware. As a teenager I always had an interest in gaming and computers; I dabbled in HTML coding at school but never really developed my skills further. My experience thus far is limited to basic skills and knowledge of communications and information systems that I have gained through courses facilitated through the Defence Force and first year Bachelor of IT subjects</p> 
            
            <p>I believe that my strengths lie more toward the programming and coding side of things, having some experience in Java, Python and HTML coding through previous subjects. However, I would consider myself very much a novice in these areas.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, through my Army experience, I have a basic understanding of information management practices and cyber security strategies. Additionally, due to my position as an Officer and having time in command of soldiers, I have a great deal of organisational leadership and management experience. Through my training I have also gained some technical understanding of networks and information systems and the ability to communicate to superiors, subordinates and peers at both the technical and non-technical level.</p>
            
            <p>Noting that almost all of us have very limited programming skills I believe our common weakness will be in developing the features of our project. However, with determination and the right attitude I am confident we will overcome this weakness and all learn in the process.</p>
            
            <p>As a result of our teams’ lack of programming experience I believe the greatest challenge that we will face will be transitioning our ideas into tangible outputs that we can demonstrate with successful functionality.</p>
            
            <p>I expect that I will contribute more on the technical aspects of the projects in developing HTML code for our website and attempting to develop the features using other coding languages such as Java, Python or any of the C varieties.</p>

	  <h2>Group Contract

</h2>
	  <p>Our core expectations and rules are made very clear to everyone in the group. Based on our mutual understanding and expectations, we have decided to meet twice every week for 15 to 20 min. One of the meetings would be set earlier in the week and the other would be closer to the end of the week. This will give each member a sufficient time to finish their set tasks and report it back to the group for further discussions and feedback. Everyone is required to attend the meeting and for some reason, if they are unable to do so, they should inform the group prior to the meeting to avoid any mishaps or confusion. One of the most crucial expectations based upon our group is that we should record our meetings on Microsoft Teams each week, with our audio and video enabled. This is because face-to-face meetings allow for clearer communication and provides a great level of professionalism which is one of the fundamentals of working in a team project.</p>
      
      Ground Rules for the meeting.
      <ol>
<li>Arrive on time</li>

      
     <li> Respect others and their thoughts</li>
     <li> Participate actively</li>
     <li> Give thoughtful feedback</li>
     <li> Respect everyone’s privacy</li>
          </ol>
<p>Everyone in the group is fully aware of their tasks and responsibilities within this group project. We have embedded a very positive and pleasant culture within our group which means that all our team members are constantly supporting each other and seeking help if they require. We as a group are always encouraging and offering support to each other so that nobody feels overburdened or stressed about their designated tasks. Our deadlines are made very clear in the group channel and everyone respects those deadlines.
*Need a table with everyone’s responsibilities listed and their due dates*
We are doing that part on Trello
Everyone in the group is respectful and responsible and knows about the requirements and expectations expected off them. However, if we do ever have to deal with unmet expectations, the process is quite simple. The two disputed parties can sit together and endeavor to sort out any misunderstandings or grudges against one and other. Usually, this step would solve the unexpected issues and concerns, however, if it still does not get resolved then the issue can be brought before a tutor in their own time outside the group meetings.
An agreed-upon method for peer feedback during the project so that problems can be addressed is that during our tutorial session and the two meetings during the week, each member will present what they have done so far and will receive insightful and thoughtful feedback in order to improve. No one in the group will ever be patronized or judged upon their respective contribution. The aim of this session is to provide as much support to each other as possible so that as a team we can succeed in this project.
The expected frequency of responses is 24 hours and all our team members are very responsive and usually reply within a few hours. However, if for some reason they are unable to do so, they can just reply when they can as we do understand that there could be personal issues that one can get caught up with.
For this IT project, our group uses various tools and resources to communicate such as Microsoft Teams and Trello. We often also make use of google.docs to enable sharing amongst the group easier and faster.</p>
