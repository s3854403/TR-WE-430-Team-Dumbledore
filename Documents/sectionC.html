      <h3> Project Description</h3>
      
<p>
Our team has decided a fantastic project which will help out people in this current situation. It is an irrefutable fact that people are gaining weight because of unhealthy eating habits and less physical activities during this lockdown situation. The name of our project is ‘Fit & Slim’. This is not any ordinary website which will provide the users only the tips and tricks to stay healthy and fit but it is more than that. Our website will not only provide tasty recipes but it will also guide the users with the good routine practices to stay fit. </p>

 

 <p>There are enormous features to talk about but starting with online calendar and booking system with the professional trainers. Our website will provide time to time professional support to the users whenever they need guidance to track their progress this also includes built in payment facility which will make things easier and reliable. Moving on, our website will also provide digital and non-digital products like exercising guides/ DVDs, cooking videos, supplements(like protein shakes), and variety of healthy food recipes. Every user will have a personal login ID and will have access to a personal trainer for support and guidance followed by personalised diet plans according to BMI(Body Mass Index) of the user and daily to do list. This task list will come with a goal and daily exercising tasks which user need to complete additional feature in this will be regular reminders so that if the user skips something, reminder will help in this case in order to complete the assigned tasks. These all features will help the user to stay fit and healthy as well as by enjoying delicious food along the workout.

  <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
      <p>Our motivation behind the Slim & Fit app came from the fact that the pandemic has seized away all the opportunities from the young youth and the elderly to live a life of their choice. Therefore, this thought in mind triggered the idea that we should create a fitness and health related app that is able to help and cater for everyone’s need, especially in this time of life. This app would be the most perfect app for the health-conscious people who want to still pursue with their fitness and health related goals despite the pandemic.</p> 

      <p>We are all self-driven to look after ourselves, especially during the pandemic when we are surrounded by complete isolation. The aim of creating this fitness related app is so we can raise awareness amongst the generation that despite what situation you are surrounded by there is no excuse to neglect your health and wellbeing. By creating this app, we will definitely be going above and beyond our current IT knowledge as we will learn and explore new things in each of the stages from the designing stage, all the way to the evaluation stage. We as a group will enrich our IT skills in different areas such as designing, programming, communication and writing skills. </p>

      <p> We did not use our IT idea from last semester, but we were inspired from our project that we did in UCD. As a group we merged the two themes together, which included fitness and health and thus came up with the idea to create Fit and Slim. This app is the most perfect app as it considers the current situation and how people are unable to go gyms and look after themselves in this lockdown. Although our UCD project was not that advanced and we have just used that as a foundation to build upon the project. We have added some incredible and advanced features such as         which acts as an incentive to motivation the youth and the elderly to look after themselves all the time despite of the current situation. </p>
      
      <h2>Project Justification</h2>
      <h3> Justified Workload </h3>

      <p>Each of us has limited skills at this stage in developing websites, applications and coding. As such, creating and implementing many of the features we intend to for this project will be a challenging endeavour for all of us. For the first half of the project the majority of our workload will be dedicated to developing our own personal skills required to create the features of our project. However, in the latter half of the project we will have all gained a lot of experience and skills and be able to devote our time more efficiently to generating outcomes and features that will ensure the success of our product.</p>
      
      <h2> Beyond Current Capabilities </h2> 
      
      <p>There is a general consensus amongst the team members of this group that we all have a weakness in the area of coding, programming and website development; with each of us only possessing basic skills at best that we have developed in previous university IT subjects. Therefore, it is clear that the development of the HTML website and the features we intend to implement will challenge all of us a great deal.</p>
  

      <p>Throughout the development of this project we will distribute the workload in such a way that all of us are equally challenged and required to acquire new skills and knowledge to be successful. For all of us the coding and technical side of things will immediately put us out of comfort zones and to overcome this we will work together and learn from each other to meet our project goals.</p>

      <h2>Project Risks </h2>

      <h3>Account creation </h3>

      <p>One of the greatest risks to our project being successful will be the correct implementation and management of account creation. If we are not able to successfully deliver this feature then we will not be able to tailor our product to individuals and will the functionality of a great deal other features. In order to mitigate this, the creation of accounts and the associated log in functions will be a priority task that will implanted early on and tested rigorously </p>

      <h3>Relevant content </h3>
      
      <p>As part of our project we will aim to provide our users with health and fitness specific content that is beneficial and of interest to them. To ensure that the content we provide is relevant and engaging for all types of users we will require some sort of survey or screening process upon initial account creation. For example, asking the user about their age, dietary preferences, fitness level, goals, etc will then enable us to provide the most relevant and tailored content for the individual user, maximising user satisfaction. </p>

      <h3>Gamification of our service </h3>
      
      <p>As part of our project, we intend to track a user’s progress and allow them to set goals and targets to work toward, and then be rewarded appropriately for meeting their goals. This poses a risk in finding the balance of offering users with realistic and meaningful goals that are also challenging for them, while also having a reward function that incentivises and motivates users to achieve these goals. </p>

      <h2>Team Dynamic Risks </h2>

      <h3>Skill level</h3> 
      
      <p> Across the board, we as a team lack technical experience and skills in the use of programming languages for website and application development. As such, this poses a major risk to the success of our team in being able to deliver our features in a timely manner. We will overcome this risk through personal development in the initial phases and a high level of cooperation to work through our technical challenges together. </p>

      <h3> Differing ideas </h3>
      
      <p>As a team, we all come from a very diverse background and have unique experiences. This means that we all look to solve problems in vastly different ways and sometimes our ideas can clash. The risk here is that we fail to effectively communicate and collaborate and our project could end up diverging from its initial trajectory. In order to combat this risk we meet regularly and all maintain an open and collaborative mindset that will enable us to take the best parts of all our ideas and merge them together. </p>

      <h3>Uncertainty </h3>
      <p>The theme of 2020 appears to be that the only certain thing is absolute uncertainty. All of us have busy schedules and a range of competing priorities such as caring for family and dependents or working full time. Because of this, there will be periods of uncertainty where team members are unable to communicate and work together effectively when they are required to attend to other matters. The best mitigation strategy to overcome this is to maintain an open mind as a team, be understanding of members’ personal circumstances and adopt a flexible approach to the project.</p>
